# Birthday-Reminder
Not finished!

We make the application with code or through a storyboard at our discretion.
1. Create a registration screen where you need to enter a login and password 2 fields and a login button that leads to the second screen.
2. By clicking on “Login” we go to the second Birthday screen (This is not a table) where birthdays will be added from the third screen. The labels “18 days” and “March 10, Wednesday…” are hardcoded.
3. By pressing the + button, we get to the third screen. Date, age, gender - pickers. Instagram - alertController.
4. Optional for those who did not feel the task and for those who want to grow as a cool programmer:
* When you click on the button with an eye on the first screen, the password from the second field should be shown instead of dots.
* Make labels from the second screen interactive so that the label shows how many days are left until the birthday, depending on today's date. And add a photo to the avatar from the phone gallery.
* Add your cool feature
